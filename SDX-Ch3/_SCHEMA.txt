This file describes the layout/callpath of the other files in this directory.

    (turns out there is no callpath. nice! but then why are these all in one big directory?)

highlights: dup.py

---- brute_force_1.py (with output_files/brute_force_1.out) -------------------

    This file is an intentionally bad example of how to detect duplicate
    files in a directory. See the file itself for running instructions,
    including command line arguments.

---- brute_force_2.py (with output_files/brute_force_2.out) -------------------

    This file is a better implementation of a brute-force method to detect
    duplicate files. See the file for running instructions, including
    command line arguments

!!-- dup.py -------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good example of how to use sha256 hashing, in this case to detect duplicate
    files. File includes running instructions

---- naive_hash.py ------------------------------------------------------------

    A simple hashing algorithm that hashes any data that can be summed.
    Intentionally simple, not meant to be used in any serious code.

... you get the idea
