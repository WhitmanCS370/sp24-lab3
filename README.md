# sp24-lab3
Lab 3, which includes (a) "Duplicate Files" adapted from [Software Design by Example](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/) by Greg Wilson (b) command line integration example with sys.argv, (c) and example of how to use the simpleaudio package to play a .wav file in Python.

_January 30, 2024_

Organization:
* SDX-Ch3: The code files for the _SDX Ch.3_ activity (as downloaded directly from the book website, unmodified) 
* TeamActivities: Has the code files for the command line activity (cli_example.py), the simpleaudio activity (simpleaudio_test.py), and two sample .wav audio files in the sounds subfolder.

## Team Members
Grant Didway
Steven Lin

## Team Roles
Who will start out as
* DRIVER: Grant
* NAVIGATOR: Steven

You will switch halfway through the _SDX Ch. 3_ activity.

## SDX Ch. 3 documentation

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from each chapter?
 - Chapter 3 was concerned with optimizing file comparisons (identifying duplicates) using hashing. 
 - Using a cryptographic hashing function, we can go from O(N^2) to O(N) time complexity.

* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
- What does the cryptographic hashing function we used built-in from python look like behind the scenes

After you've modified/remixed the code, write a summary of what you did and why below:
