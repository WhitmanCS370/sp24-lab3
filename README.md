# sp24-lab3
Lab 3, which includes (a) "Duplicate Files" adapted from [Software Design by Example](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/) by Greg Wilson (b) command line integration example with sys.argv, (c) and example of how to use the simpleaudio package to play a .wav file in Python.

_January 30, 2024_

Organization:
* SDX-Ch3: The code files for the _SDX Ch.3_ activity (as downloaded directly from the book website, unmodified) 
* TeamActivities: Has the code files for the command line activity (cli_example.py), the simpleaudio activity (simpleaudio_test.py), and two sample .wav audio files in the sounds subfolder.

## Team Members

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from each chapter?
  the main idea from the chapter was using hashing to find duplicate files and how to make finding duplicate files more efficient
* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
  how is the cryptographic hash function made and more than that how do you make an efficient hash function?
After you've modified/remixed the code, write a summary of what you did and why below:
