# sp24-lab3
Lab 3, which includes (a) "Duplicate Files" adapted from [Software Design by Example](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/) by Greg Wilson (b) command line integration example with sys.argv, (c) and example of how to use the simpleaudio package to play a .wav file in Python.

_January 30, 2024_

Organization:
* SDX-Ch3: The code files for the _SDX Ch.3_ activity (as downloaded directly from the book website, unmodified) 
* TeamActivities: Has the code files for the command line activity (cli_example.py), the simpleaudio activity (simpleaudio_test.py), and two sample .wav audio files in the sounds subfolder.

## Team Members
Shahrom Dehoti, Uli Raudales

## Team Roles
Who will start out as
* DRIVER: Shahrom 
* NAVIGATOR: Uli

You will switch halfway through the _SDX Ch. 3_ activity.

## SDX Ch. 3 documentation

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from each chapter?
<!-- Cryptographic hash function is used which ensures an even distribution of files between groups. Coming up with an algorithm for those problems otherwise would result in a longer time complexity and hashing helps us to make it more efficient. -->
* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
<!-- Since me and Uli are familiar with hashing and Big O notation at this point, this chapter was easy to understand. So, we don't have any questions for today. -->

After you've modified/remixed the code, write a summary of what you did and why below:
<!-- 1. We can delete shell files because they won't work on any system that doesn't have a Bash. We can just run the python file instead and pass it a CL argument. It can clean up the amount of files available and create less clutter and confusion.
2. We commented naive_hash.py and using_sha256.py to make the code more understandable. We can implement the same idea to every other file but it would take too much time so we just did it in those 2 files for a preview.-->
After you've worked on the exercises, write a summary of what you did and why below:
