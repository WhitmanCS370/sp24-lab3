-  
* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?

After you've modified/remixed the code, write a summary of what you did and why below:

After you've worked on the exercises, write a summary of what you did and why below:

We got to exercise 2 and we had a working idea for exercise 2 but not enough time to implement.
