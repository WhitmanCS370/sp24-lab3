# sp24-lab3
Lab 3, which includes (a) "Duplicate Files" adapted from [Software Design by Example](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/) by Greg Wilson (b) command line integration example with sys.argv, (c) and example of how to use the simpleaudio package to play a .wav file in Python.

Organization:
* SDX-Ch3: The code files for the _SDX Ch.3_ activity (as downloaded directly from the book website, unmodified) 
* TeamActivities: Has the code files for the command line activity (cli_example.py), the simpleaudio activity (simpleaudio_test.py), and two sample .wav audio files in the sounds subfolder.

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from each chapter?

Explaining what hashing is

    Creating an even distribution among groups

How to increase efficiency of hashing

Choosing the right data structure

* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?

After you've modified/remixed the code, write a summary of what you did and why below:

After you've worked on the exercises, write a summary of what you did and why below:

1. We found that coffee-slurp-6.wav and coffee.wav contain the same contents.  We didn't need to change the existing code.

2. We created three new functions, one to load, one to save, and one to check duplicates. We found one duplicate between new-sounds and sounds which was coffe-slurp-new-1.wav. Afterwards, modified dup2.py so that it would also return which file the duplicate matchd with in our existing sounds.
