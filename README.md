# sp24-lab3
Lab 3, which includes (a) "Duplicate Files" adapted from [Software Design by Example](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/) by Greg Wilson (b) command line integration example with sys.argv, (c) and example of how to use the simpleaudio package to play a .wav file in Python.

_January 30, 2024_

Organization:
* SDX-Ch3: The code files for the _SDX Ch.3_ activity (as downloaded directly from the book website, unmodified) 
* TeamActivities: Has the code files for the command line activity (cli_example.py), the simpleaudio activity (simpleaudio_test.py), and two sample .wav audio files in the sounds subfolder.

## Team Members

You will switch halfway through the _SDX Ch. 3_ activity.

## SDX Ch. 3 documentation

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from each chapter?
  * First were introduced to brute force in finding duplicates and evolved to higher efficency using hashing. We looked into some hash algorithms like using utf-8 encoding on each string to sort into buckets or using SHA-256 to encode it     based on it's algorithm.
* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
  * We discussed our skeptism of 50% chance of 2 people in a group of 20 having the same bday.   

After you've modified/remixed the code, write a summary of what you did and why below:
