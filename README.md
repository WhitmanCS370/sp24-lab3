# sp24-lab3
Lab 3, which includes (a) "Duplicate Files" adapted from [Software Design by Example](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/) by Greg Wilson (b) command line integration example with sys.argv, (c) and example of how to use the simpleaudio package to play a .wav file in Python.

_January 30, 2024_

Organization:
* SDX-Ch3: The code files for the _SDX Ch.3_ activity (as downloaded directly from the book website, unmodified) 
* TeamActivities: Has the code files for the command line activity (cli_example.py), the simpleaudio activity (simpleaudio_test.py), and two sample .wav audio files in the sounds subfolder.

## Team Members
Coden Stark, Clara Bates

## Team Roles
Who will start out as
* DRIVER: Coden
* NAVIGATOR: Clara

You will switch halfway through the _SDX Ch. 3_ activity.

## SDX Ch. 3 documentation

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from chapter?
  It covered how to find duplicate files and hashing stuff.
* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
  "sys.argv[1:]" appeared repeatedly, but what does it mean?

After you've modified/remixed the code, write a summary of what you did and why below:
We removed all of the out files and annotated dup.py to explain the specific steps of the algorithm.


After you've worked on the exercises, write a summary of what you did and why below:
